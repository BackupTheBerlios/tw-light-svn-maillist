- * -#  The proper indentation amount is 1 tab.  If you don't like that (or if

- * If you don't like that either, AT LEAST BE INTERNALLY CONSISTENT IN YOUR

- * -#  In the same vein, do not use an editor that transparently replaces N
- * spaces with the &quot;equivalent&quot; tabs.  Or, if you must do so, make sure that
- * your indentation amount exactly matches the tab size.  Otherwise your
- * indentation will apear totally fucked up on other editors with different tab
- * sizes.  And don't use an editor that replaces tabs with spaces either.
